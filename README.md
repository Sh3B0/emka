## Idea

Deploying a web application (**Express** + **MongoDB**) with **Kubernetes** on **Azure**, following security best practices recommended by [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-security) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/).

## Application

- The application being deployed is a sample application showing user info and allows updating them.

- Data is being stored and retrieved from MongoDB.

- To test the application locally, simply run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`, then navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Architecture

## Deployment

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are used.

  ```bash
  # Login to Azure cli
  $ az login
  
  # Create a resource group
  $ az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westeurope
  
  # Create container registry (to store app image)
  $ az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name sh3b0cr --sku Basic
  
  # Login to container registry
  $ az acr login --name sh3b0cr
  
  # Get AcrLoginServer name
  $ az acr list --resource-group myResourceGroup --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table
  
  # Tag app image with AcrLoginServer
  $ docker tag emka_app:v1 sh3b0cr.azurecr.io/emka_app:v1
  
  # Push app image to registry
  $ docker push sh3b0cr.azurecr.io/emka_app:v1
  
  # Deploy app to Azure Kubernetes Service
  $ az aks create \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --name myAKSCluster \
      --node-count 2 \
      --generate-ssh-keys \
      --attach-acr sh3b0cr
      
  # Install kubectl
  $ az aks install-cli
  
  # Connect to AKS Cluster using kubectl 
  $ az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
  
  # Show nodes
  $ kubectl get nodes

## Security Considerations

Almost all security aspects are managed by the cloud provider, here we demonstrate our understanding of the security measures taken.

### Application and Image Security

- When installing application dependencies with `npm install`, we made sure that no vulnerabilities were found in the used versions of the dependencies.
- Docker also provides `docker scan` addon which we can configure to run periodically to scan the image against vulnerability databases such as Snyk and alert on found issues.
- Database credentials are implemented using K8s secrets which are stored in `etcd`, the cloud provider ensures [encryption at rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-security#:~:text=Etcd%20store%20is%20fully%20managed%20by%20AKS%20and%20data%20is%20encrypted%20at%20rest%20within%20the%20Azure%20platform.) with a platform-managed key.
- // https

### Registry Security

- Application image is deployed to Azure Container Registry with RBAC configured to only allow the K8s cluster to pull the image.

### Cluster Security

#### Worker nodes security

- As demonstrated above, **worker nodes use a private IP address range** that is not publicly accessible from the Internet. This ensures that individual nodes are not vulnerable to any remote attacks. The physical security of the nodes is ensured by the cloud provider.

#### Master server security

- **Public master API:** when creating the cluster we can use `--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`  to restrict the range of IP address authorized to access the API.
- **Private master API:** a more secure [setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters) would be to have a private master API; Communication with the API can then be done by establishing a VPN Tunnel, or using  `az aks command invoke` which allows invoking commands like `kubectl` remotely through Azure API without directly connecting to the cluster.

### OS security for nodes

- Worker nodes are running Linux servers with the latest security updates and patches.
- Itâ€™s the responsibility of the cloud provider to schedule nightly updates of the worker nodes with minimal disruption to the service.

### Network Security

- The private subnet where nodes are deployed should be isolated from any other subnets through firewalls, this is also the responsibility of the cloud provider.
